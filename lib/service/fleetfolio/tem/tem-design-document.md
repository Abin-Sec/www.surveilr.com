# Opsfolio Threat Exposure Management (TEM) Design Document

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document outlines the design of **Opsfolio Threat Exposure Management
(TEM)** and its integration with **Opsfolio Suite** and **Surveilr**.\
It compares Opsfolio with **PlexTrac** and other industry players in the
**Threat Exposure Management (TEM)** and **Continuous Threat Exposure Management
(CTEM)** space, while highlighting Opsfolio‚Äôs unique positioning in combining
**exposure management with compliance evidence pipelines**.

---

## 2. Background & Context

Organizations face an ever-expanding attack surface across cloud, on-premises,
and hybrid infrastructures. Traditional vulnerability management approaches are
insufficient for real-time visibility and continuous threat exposure management
(TEM/CTEM).

- **Problem:** Traditional pentest and vulnerability assessment reports are
  static (PDFs, spreadsheets), making them difficult to track, correlate, and
  act upon.
- **Opportunity:** Deliver **real-time, SQL-queryable TEM data** directly tied
  to regulatory compliance workflows (POA&M, SOC2, CMMC, HIPAA, FedRAMP).
- **Drivers:**
  - Increasing regulatory demands.
  - Shorter remediation cycles.
  - Multi-tenant support for MSP/MSSPs.
  - Customer demand for **compliance-linked security validation**.

**Opsfolio Suite** (with **Surveilr**) provides a unified, auditable, and
compliance-ready solution for identifying, prioritizing, validating, and
remediating security exposures. By combining **continuous discovery,
SQL-queryable evidence, compliance mapping, and automation workflows**, Opsfolio
bridges the gap between IT security and regulatory requirements in ways that
existing platforms like **PlexTrac, Wiz, Palo Alto Cortex XSIAM, Cisco
Vulnerability Management, Intruder, Pentera, and Aikido Security** do not.

## How It Works: Continuous Threat Exposure Management

Opsfolio aligns with the **CTEM lifecycle**:

1. **Scope** ‚Üí Define assets, identities, applications, and cloud infrastructure
   in scope.
2. **Discover** ‚Üí Continuously collect evidence using integrated tools and
   agents.
3. **Prioritize** ‚Üí Map exposures to business risk, compliance impact, and
   exploitability.
4. **Validate** ‚Üí Confirm exposures through adversary emulation and automated
   re-tests.
5. **Mobilize** ‚Üí Trigger remediation workflows (Jira, ServiceNow, Slack) and
   generate audit-ready reports.

---

## Customer Benefits

- **Compliance-First TEM**: Aligns exposures with SOC2, FedRAMP, HIPAA, HITRUST,
  and FDA SaMD.
- **Auditability**: Every action and data point stored in Surveilr for
  traceability.
- **Data Privacy**: No forced cloud vendor lock-in; evidence stays private
  unless explicitly shared.
- **Integration Ready**: Works with best-in-class open-source and commercial
  tools.
- **Reduced Risk**: Provides a single pane of glass for vulnerabilities,
  exposures, and compliance risks.

## 3. Competitive Landscape

### 3.1 PlexTrac Benchmark

PlexTrac positions itself as a leading TEM/CTEM platform with the following
features:
