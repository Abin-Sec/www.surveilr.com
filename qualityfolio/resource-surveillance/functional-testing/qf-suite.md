## Scope of Work

The testing will cover the following key activities across APIs:

### Functional Testing

- Verify the accuracy of each API endpoint against defined test cases and the provided API documentation.
- Validate input and response parameters, including headers and status codes.
- Conduct boundary value analysis and test edge cases, such as handling empty requests, invalid inputs, and other unexpected scenarios.
- Confirm the correctness and completeness of the data retrieved by APIs.
- Ensure APIs effectively handle edge cases like invalid serial numbers or missing data.
