### Project Overview
The Surveilr Functional Testing project involves comprehensive testing to ensure the system functions as expected when ingesting, processing, and reporting data. The project focuses on testing data format compatibility, system performance under load, and accuracy of reports.

### Scope
The testing effort will encompass the following key activities:

 - Functional Testing
     - Verify the accuracy of each API endpoint against defined test cases and the provided API documentation.
     - Validate input and response parameters, including headers and status codes.
     - Conduct boundary value analysis and test edge cases, such as handling empty requests, invalid inputs, and other unexpected scenarios.
     - Confirm the correctness and completeness of the data retrieved by APIs.
     - Ensure APIs effectively handle edge cases like invalid serial numbers or missing data.
