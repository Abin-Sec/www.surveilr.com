In cybersecurity, compliance, and software engineering, the term _resource_ can
be used in a variety of contexts. Generally, it refers to any identifiable item
that serves as an asset within a systemâ€”such as a file, folder, device, or any
data component that holds value. Managing resources effectively is a key aspect
of maintaining security, ensuring compliance, and managing information systems
efficiently.

### What is an RSSD Resource?

A **resource** can be any entity that contains data or is used to facilitate
system operations. In a typical information system, resources include files,
devices, network components, web services, users, applications, and more.
Effective resource management helps ensure security, efficiency, and compliance
by allowing for proper monitoring, maintenance, and control of these entities.

Resources can be files in a file system, an email message from an email box,
issues in a product lifecycle management (PLM) system like GitHub or Jira, or
almost any other kind of "blob" or "clob" or similar data that we want to
"surveil". Effective resource management helps ensure security, efficiency, and
compliance by allowing for proper monitoring, maintenance, and control of these
entities.

Resources, therefore, have some key attributes:

- **Identification**: Each resource must be uniquely identifiable.
- **Nature**: Resources have a type or nature, such as "file", "device",
  "database entry", etc.
- **Access Control**: Resources typically require controlled access.
- **Immutability**: In certain high-security systems, resources are managed
  using an immutable, append-only approach, ensuring that all changes are
  tracked over time.
