Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.42.1


## What's New
---

### 1. New suite of SQlite helper functions
    New functions have been directly inegrated into `surveilr` as is from the SQLite counterparts.
    - [sqlite-html](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-html/blob/main/docs.md).
    - [sqlite-url](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-url/blob/main/docs.md).
    - [sqlite-http](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-http/blob/main/docs.md).

### 2. Enhanced Uniform Resource Provenance
    The `uniform_resource` table is now well connected to the actual resource that was ingested as opposed to being connected to the resource container.
