Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.33.0


## What's New
---

 This version introduces significant enhancements to extend functionality and improve file processing capabilities:



### 1. `sqlean` Integration  
   All [**sqlean** functions](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/tree/main/docs) have been fully integrated into surveilr, offering an expanded range of SQLite functionalities for streamlined data management and analysis.

### 2. Enhanced File Ingestion Support
   We've expanded support for file ingestion to include PDF, PPTX, PPT, XLS, XLSX, DOC, and DOCX formats. The binary-encoded contents of these files are now automatically stored in the `content` field of the `uniform_resource` table for easier processing and retrieval.
