  subTitle: |
    FleetFolio bridges the gap between infrastructure monitoring, security, and compliance. Rather than relying on guesswork, it delivers a data-driven, evidence-based approach to asset assurance. Unlike traditional asset management tools that simply list discovered assets, FleetFolio takes a proactive approach by defining expected infrastructure assets and verifying them against actual assets found using osQuery Management Server (MS).  
descriptionList:
  - title: "Identifying Reliability Issues"
    subTitle: "If an expected asset (server, VM, container) is missing, it could indicate a downtime event, misconfiguration, or failure. FleetFolio flags missing assets, allowing teams to respond before they impact operations."
  - title: "Detecting Unauthorized Assets"
    subTitle: "If an asset is found but was not expected, it could be a security risk—such as a rogue machine, unauthorized cloud instance, or compromised system. FleetFolio detects unauthorized assets in real time."
  - title: "Ensuring Compliance & Governance"
    subTitle: "Regulatory frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2) require organizations to track and validate infrastructure components. FleetFolio ensures compliance by verifying that only approved assets exist and that nothing is missing."
  - title: "Automating Infrastructure Audits"
    subTitle: "FleetFolio eliminates the need for manual asset audits by continuously reconciling expected vs. actual infrastructure and generating real-time reports for IT, security, and compliance teams."
