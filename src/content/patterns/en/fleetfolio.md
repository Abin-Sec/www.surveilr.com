  subTitle: |
    Fleetfolio continuously pulls data from a variety of sources—network, endpoint, cloud systems, and vulnerability scanning tools—to create and maintain an accurate, real-time inventory of all assets and identities within your organization. By correlating this data, Fleetfolio ensures that no device, user, or application is overlooked, eliminating outdated or incomplete information and providing real-time visibility into the asset landscape. It integrates seamlessly with your existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs), enhancing both the asset discovery process and the accuracy of the asset inventory. Through bi-directional integration, Fleetfolio enriches SIEM data with detailed asset context, enabling more precise alert correlation and faster detection of threats. Simultaneously, it updates the CMDB with up-to-date asset information, ensuring all records are aligned and enhancing workflows for streamlined compliance reporting and incident response. This integrated, dynamic approach ensures continuous visibility, improved security, and more efficient risk management across your digital environment.
